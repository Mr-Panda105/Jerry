Dear Jerry,

My respect and love for you will always remain. If my words ever hurt you or if I become too emotional, please forgive me.

You should know that I’ve been in two relationships before — one ended in betrayal, and the other I had no real interest in. I’ve shared everything with you. I’ve also told you since when I started liking you. Now you might think I’m repeating the same things again, but I’m not.

Honestly, I miss the last moments I spent with you, and the last messages we exchanged. I don’t even know how much I truly love you. But whenever I remember those final times with you, it feels like something is missing, like there’s an emptiness inside.

Remembering the last things you said makes me feel bad. Sometimes I wonder if I hadn’t expressed my feelings, maybe things would still be different. Maybe you wouldn’t have known how much I loved you.

You know!  
Whenever I miss you, I listen to your voice messages that you sent on Messenger and Instagram. I look at the pictures you gave me and wonder why I have become so weak for you.

You might think I have forgotten you after all this time, but I’m sorry — I still haven’t been able to forget you.

I know we will never be together. Because a Brahmin can never see the moon. Yet, with a sky as vast as this, I wish to see you once with my own eyes.

If I start to tell you everything in my heart, it will never end. I won’t exaggerate anymore.

If any of my words hurt you, if I make you angry or feel annoyed, please forgive me.

For my last words, I will say: stay well and be happy.  
I love you. Allah Hafez.
